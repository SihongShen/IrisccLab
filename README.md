# Iris's ccLab

here you can see my codes:
https://github.com/SihongShen/IrisccLab

and this is the live version of it on Github Pages:
https://sihongshen.github.io/IrisccLab/

this is the root, or very base of my cclab folder.

if you see this on a url or looks like

sihongshen.github.io/repo-name

then you can append project/website/folder names to the url to
get to the actual webpages.
